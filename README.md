Practice for a react CRUD blog app

I spent the first few days working through a tutorial to build a basic CRUP app in React. I then copied the directory and made a new repo. To make the blog, I added features, like the show screen and comments. This origin is why some of the variables and components have unusual names related to accounts.

Sticking points:
-render image in show screen
--believe that a true back-end and separate server could help with this
-JSON.stringify doesn't work on a file object.
I tried many solutions including obscure npm packages that each required a lot of debugging and I still didn't get them to work.
