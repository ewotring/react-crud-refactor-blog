# react-crud-refactor-blog
Practice for a react CRUD blog app

Built with Yarn

I spent the first few days working through a tutorial to build a basic CRUP app in React. I then copied the directory and made a new repo. To make the blog, I added features, like the show screen and comments.

Sticking points:
-render image in show screen
-believe that a true back-end and separate server could help with this
-JSON.stringify doesn't work on a file object.
-I tried many solutions including obscure npm packages that each required a lot of debugging and I still didn't get them to work.

The two big points that I would still like to implement are user sign-in and sign-up and a proper back-end server with a database in place of using local storage.

I also would like to write tests to ensure that refactoring does not harm the functionality.
